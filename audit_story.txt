python storytelling.py --data_object "science.txt"


Alice issues the command iput -R scienceResc science.txt
Alice then grants Bobby write access to science.txt. To do that Alice needs to first give access to her home directory
and then to the file in the directory. She issues the following commands
 ichmod write bobby /tempZone/home/alice
 ichmod write bobby science.txt

Bobby now has access to Alice's file and can do some science on it.
Bobby accesses the file by typing iget /tempZone/home/alice/science.txt

In the meantime Alice decides that she needs to add some metadata to the file
imeta -d science.txt doc_type some_science
